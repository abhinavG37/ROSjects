# ROSJECTS DESCRIPTION
Always remember to source your **devel/setup.bash** file into **~/.bashrc**  
I had conflicting package names in ROSJect_2 mybot, which **roscd** could not find.  
Remember to always have different package names.
## ROSject_1



A basic ROSJect for a **Hello World** package
* Implements a Talker and a Listener node
* Adds a number of changes to the CMakeLists.txt of **hello_world** to accomodate a custom message file **num.msg**
* Due to auto CMake reload, a redundant **helloWorld** folder gets created, yet to remove it

##ROSject_2
